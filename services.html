				<h1>Remedial Massage</h1>
				<p>Also called deep tissue massage, remedial massage targets painful points and releases tension. During your massage, we will try to identify any key trigger points, which might be causing pain and deliver a remedial massage targeted to your needs. If you believe in “no pain, no gain”, we bet that you would love this treatment.</p>

				<h1>Hot Stone Massage</h1>
				<p>A hot stone massage is a type of massage therapy,  used to help you relax and ease tense muscles and damaged soft tissues throughout your body. Anyone who is experiencing muscle tension and pain, insomnia, or stress may benefit from a hot stone massage. During a hot stone massage, smooth, flat, heated stones are placed on specific parts of your body. The stones are usually made of basalt, a type of volcanic rock that retains heat. Hot stones are usually heated to between 130 and 145 degrees. If you have a chronic condition that causes pain, come and talk to our massage therapists to see if a hot stone massage is a good option for you. </p>

				<h1>Aroma Massage</h1>
				<p>Aromatherapy massage is a Swedish relaxation massage therapy using massage oil or lotion that contains essential oils to promote healing and a feeling of well-being and relaxation in the recipient. Essential oils are extracted from herbs and plants and contain all the properties of the plants themselves. They are thought to promote beneficial changes in your mind and body by affecting the limbic system, a region of the brain known to influence the nervous system. It is often for clients with sore back, neck, and shoulders or to ease stress. Aroma Massage may also help with anxiety, dementia symptoms, depression, insomnia, menstrual pain, and can provide supportive care for people with conditions such as cancer.</p>

				<h1>Pregnancy Massage</h1>
				<p>Pregnancy massage has gained a lot in popularity over recent years.

Our massage therapists have successfully fulfilled the requirements for a certification of Pregnancy Massage from Pregnancy Massage Australia.</p>

			<div id="lymphatic" class="concontainer">

				<h1>Lymphatic Drainage</h1>
				<p>Lymphatic drainage Massage (LDM) uses light pressure and long, gentle, rhythmic strokes designed to boost the lymphatic system and get rid of all the toxins and impurities in the body. It opens up the lymphatic system, allowing it to flow better and work more optimally. Superb for cellulite, lymphatic drainage helps fatty deposits breakdown and pass more easily through the lymphatic system ready for elimination. LDM may be helpful with fighting off infections, reducing water retention, boosting digestion and weight loss and reducing stress and fatigue.</p>

			<div id="reflex" class="concontainer">
				<img src="serref.jpg" alt=""/>
				<h1>Reflexology</h1>
				<p>Reflexology, also known as zone therapy, is an alternative treatment involving application of pressure to the feet and hands with specific thumb, finger, and hand techniques. It is based on the concept that zones and reflex areas reflect an image of the body on the feet and hands, with the premise that such work effects a physical change to the body. It is believed that energy runs through the body in channels known as meridians and that massage of the feet stimulates these energy channels, promoting healing and relaxation. Every part of the foot corresponds to an area of the body, and massage of the feet stimulates the corresponding part of the body, so that receiving a reflexology massage is regarded as the equivalent of a full body massage. Reflexology increases the flow of energy, increases the circulation and stimulates the digestive system.</p>

			<div id="cupping" class="concontainer">
				<img src="sercups.jpg" alt=""/>
				<h1>Cupping Therapy</h1>
				<p>Cupping is a type of alternative therapy that originated in China. It involves placing cups on the skin to create suction. The suction helps to promote bloodflow. Cairns Massage Champions uses a modern approach to cupping therapy by using a rubber pump instead of burning to create the suction within the cup. This allows the cup to be easily manoeuvred on the skin for a massage-like effect. Cupping therapy may help relieve shingles, facial paralysis and acne along with many other conditions.</p>

Dry needling is mainly used to treat myofascial trigger points, but it is also used to target connective tissue, neural ailments, and muscular ailments. Dry needling can be used to treat dysfunction of skeletal muscle and connective tissue, minimize pain, and improve or regulate structural or functional damage.</p>
